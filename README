trapdoor2 (td2) allows remote users to execute local commands by sending 'magic
cookies'. this can e.g. be used to alter local firewalling rules so people can
connect to local services after sending the magick cookie.

td2 is implemented as high-secure https server. the daemon processes are
running in a chroot jail with multiple rlimits set. even if td2 can be
exploited (e.g. using a hypothetical security hole in the SSL implementation),
it is very unlikely that the attacker can execute any commands on the machine
and/or can cause any damage.

however - there never is a 100% guarantee that a system is secure. we believe
that trapdoor2 can be used to make systems more secure, but if you use it, you
do so on your own risk.


installing td2 is as easy as with most other packages:

  ./configure && make && make install


next a configuration file (/etc/td2/td2.conf) should be created:

  daemon yes
  listenport 8042

  cookie demo
	hash $apr1$js2YUvBw$TjD5hGjxWxJSJ3hSvSOqX1
	command "/bin/bash /etc/td2/openport.sh 80 10 $IP"
	response http://foobar.example.com/

the first line will let td2 run in daemon-mode, the 2nd line specifies the tcp
port and the remaining 4 lines that "openport.sh 80 10 $IP" should be executed
when a cookie matching the given hash is received. The cookie hash can be
created using gencookie(1). The response line is optional and contains a URL to
which the user will be redirected if the request is authenticated successfully.

more information about the config file format can be found in the example
configuration file (/etc/td2/td2.conf.example) and td2.conf(5).


at last a key and certificate for the https server needs to be created:

  openssl genrsa -out /etc/td2/key.pem 1024
  openssl req -new -key /etc/td2/key.pem -out /etc/td2/cert.csr
  openssl x509 -req -days 7125 -in /etc/td2/cert.csr -signkey /etc/td2/key.pem -out /etc/td2/cert.pem


simply executing 'td2' now will start the trapdoor2 daemon.
